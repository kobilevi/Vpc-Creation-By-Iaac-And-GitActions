# Vpc-Creation-By-Iaac-And-GitHub Actions
This project leverages Terraform to automate the deployment of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Using GitGub Actions CI/CD.

* The VPC is configured with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16, providing a scalable and isolated network environment. Within this VPC, two subnets are created: 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24, offering segmented IP spaces for different components or services.
The code will create two EC2 instances are connected to an Application Load Balancer, facilitating load distribution and high availability. The ALB listens on port 80 for incoming traffic.

* for the Ec2 instances will be linkage a Security Group(SG) that allows Ports 80 and 22
  
**Key Features:**

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: The VPC deployment and EC2 instance provisioning are defined and managed as code using Terraform, offering a version-controlled and repeatable infrastructure setup.
**GitActions CI/CD Pipeline**: A GitHub Actions workflow automates Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), ensuring efficient testing, validation, and deployment processes.

**Prerequisites:**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* Terraform Installed: Make sure you have Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download it from Terraform's official website.

* AWS Credentials: Configure your AWS credentials with the necessary permissions for VPC, EC2, and ALB management. You can set these credentials using the AWS CLI or environment variables.

* Git: Ensure that Git is installed on your machine for cloning and managing the project repository.

**Getting Started:**

1.Clone the repository to your local environment.

2.Configure your cloud provider credentials in the Terraform configuration files.(locate in yaml file-env section)-

3.Customize the Terraform variables to meet your specific requirements, including instance types, CIDRs and ALB settings.

4.Commit and push changes to trigger the GitActions CI/CD pipeline.
